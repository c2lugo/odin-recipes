        <p><em>The perfect french fries recipe! These fries are so crispy they stay that way even after they’ve gone cold. 
            It’s rare to find fries this good even at up-market bistros!.</em> </p>
            <h3>Ingredient needed...</h3>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Potato. The type is important. Starchy, floury potatoes 
                        are the potatoes you need for crispy fries.
                    <li>Vinegar. For simmering the potatoes, 
                        it is one secret weapon for perfect fries. There is no trace of vinegar flavour once cooked. 
                        See Step 4 below for the why.</li>
                    <li>Salt. For seasoning the water so the 
                        potatoes are seasoned all the way through.</li>
                    <li>Oil. For frying. I use vegetable or canola oil which are neutrally-flavoured oils.
                        Re-using the oil: The oil can be re-used 3 to 4 times, or more. 
                        It won’t even need to be strained. Just cool, pour into jars and keep in the pantry, 
                        and have a browse in this recipe collection to decide what to make next!</li>

            <h3>Instructions. How to make!</h3>
                <p><strong>Step 1: Cut Potatoes</strong>First, we have to cut our fries. A neat little crispy fries trick you may not have seen before: use a serrated knife to cut the potatoes. Though not visible to the eye, it makes the surface rougher therefore creating more surface area to crisp up = crispier fries!
                    What size to cut the fries: 6 mm / 1/4″ batons is the ideal size for optimum crispiness and fluffy insides. Thicker = less crispy. Thinner = not enough fluffiness inside.
                    How to slice: Cut a whole potato into 6 mm / 1/4″ thick slices. Stack 2 or 3 slices then cut into 6 mm / 1/4″ thick batons.  </p>
                <p><strong>Step 2: Place in Water</strong>Keep cut fries in water to prevent them from browning as you continue cutting. No soaking time is actually required. A simple rinse followed by simmering the potatoes in vinegar water takes care of this for us. </p>
                <p><strong>Step 3:Rinse</strong>Once all the fries are cut, place in a colander then rinse under tap water for 15 – 20 seconds. This is the first step to remove excess sugars from the surface of the potatoes (more on the “why” of this below, but in short it’s to aid crispiness – of course!). Meanwhile, the insides remain untouched by water so they’ll cook up nice and fluffy. </p>

                <p><strong>Step 4: Cook in Vinegar Water</strong>Once the potatoes are rinsed, place them in a pot with cold tap water, vinegar and salt. Bring to a boil on high heat then immediately turn down to low so the surface is barely rippling. Cook for 10 minutes.  </p>  
                <p><strong>Step 5: Drain and dry</strong>Use a spider or large slotted spoon to remove the potatoes from the water into a colander. Then carefully spread the potatoes out on two tea towel-lined trays to steam dry for 5 minutes. No need to pat them dry, the residual heat will do the job for us.</p>
                <p><strong>Step 6: Cooking Vessel and Oil</strong>Cooking vessel – Use a heavy-based, large pot that is at least 10 cm / 4″ deep. We need:
                    Oil depth – 3 cm / 1.2″ of oil (1 litre/quart for the pictured 24cm / 10″ pot). It’s barely deep-frying, it’s more like shallow-frying!
                    Safety headroom – 7 cm / 2.8″ headroom above the surface of the oil for safety purposes as the oil bubbles up quite a lot when we fry. ⚠️ THIS IS IMPORTANT! Oil overflow is a real risk if you do not do this. It’s scary and dangerous, as I found out first hand! Learn from my mistakes. ☺️
                    Oil temperature – Preheat the oil to 205°C/400°F. Use a thermometer to monitor the temperature. I use a Thermapen, see my Essential Kitchenwares post for more details.</p>
                <p><strong>Step 7: Fry #1</strong>Cook the fries in 3 batches – Separate the cooked potatoes into 3 even piles (batches). We will be doing Fry #1 in three batches in a 24 cm / 10″ pot. If your pot is larger or smaller, adjust the number of batches accordingly so all the fries in one batch can float in a single layer in the oil.
                    Add 1/3 of Batch #1 – Using a spider or slotted spoon, carefully add 1/3 of the first batch into the oil.
                    ⚠️ WAIT 10 seconds then add another 1/3 of batch #1. Pausing before adding more fries is important to ensure the oil doesn’t bubble up too high. Use this time to load up, ready to add more fries.
                    Repeat – Wait 10 seconds, then add the final 1/3 of Batch #1.
                    Fry 50 seconds – Once all the fries are in, start the timer and fry for 50 seconds, moving the fries around once or twice.</p>
                <p><strong>Step 8: Cool 30 minutes</strong>Remove the fries from the oil using a slotted spoon and spread onto a paper towel-lined tray in a single layer. They will be pale and not yet crispy.
                    Carry out Fry #1 for the remaining two batches using the same staggered approach (ie. 1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3) within each batch. Ensure the oil is back at 205°C/400°F before starting each batch. Then cool all the fries for 30 minutes on some paper towel-lined trays. </p>
                <p><strong>Step 9: Fry #2</strong>After cooling the fries, heat the oil to 205°C/400°F again. Now fry half all the french fries for 4 minutes until they are a gorgeous golden colour and wonderfully crispy.
                    Remove with a slotted spoon into a large paper towel-lined bowl then repeat with the remaining fries.</p>
                <p><strong>Step 10: Seasoning!</strong>Now that your fries are done, sprinkle with salt or your favourite fries seasoning while hot so the salt sticks. Toss, then serve! Remember, these fries will stay crispy for more than 15 minutes, though of course they are best consumed piping hot! </p>
